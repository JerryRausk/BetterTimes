## module
Module has to be set to "CommonJS" in order for imports in the api to work. Inspired by an example from vercel https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/api

## include
Do we need to include "./api"? No idea, try removing it later.

## esModuleInterop
Is this needed? No idea, try removing it later
